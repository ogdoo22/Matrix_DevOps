# Matrix
This is a repository that I will use to demonstrate different applications

1. The 1st application I created is called matrix.bat. 
To run matrix.bat in a commandline just type: matrix.bat
To exit, click: ctrl + C
When it prompts you to terminate, type in 'Y' and press enter.

2. The 2nd app is a chrome extension that gives "google.com" a matrix background.
