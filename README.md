# Matrix
This is a repository that I will use to demonstrate different applications

1. The 1st application I created is called matrix.bat. 
To run matrix.bat in a commandline just type: matrix.bat
To exit, click: ctrl + C
When it prompts you to terminate, type in 'Y' and press enter.

2. The 2nd app is a chrome extension that gives "google.com" a matrix background.
   - To enable this chrome extension:
      a. Have google chrome
      b. Enable developer mode in google chrome
      c. click extensions in google chrome
      d. Click "Load Unpacked"
      c. select the "filter chrome extension" directory
   The extension should now be active
